<h1>Tommy Portfolio Website</h1>
This site's goal is to showcase my frontend abilities while also displaying my professional portfolio and resume.<br>
Complete with visual accessibility settings & full keyboard navigation compatibility.

My challenge for this project was to incorporate all my UX development skills and make the website as accessible as possible.
