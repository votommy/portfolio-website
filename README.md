<h1>Tommy Portfolio Website (v2)</h1>
This site's goal is to showcase my frontend abilities while also displaying my professional portfolio and resume.<br>
Complete with visual accessibility settings & full keyboard navigation.

My challenge for this project was to incorporate all my UX design skills and make the website as accessible as possible.
