                                Hey! I'm Tommy, a software developer based in Missouri.<br><br>
                                I have a passion for software design, visual arts, and all things tech.<br><br>
                                I recently graduated from <a href="https://nwmissouri.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Northwest Missouri State University</a> with my bachelor's in Computer Science.<br>
                                At my most recent job as a fullstack Software Developer, I made web applications for my school. I worked on many helpful tools that are being used by my university on a daily basis.<br>
